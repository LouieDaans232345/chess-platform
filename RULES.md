# Coding Rules and Guidelines

## General Guidelines
**Code Readability**: Write code that is easy to read and understand. Use meaningful variable and function names.

**Consistent Naming Conventions**:
   - Use `snake_case` for variable and function names (e.g., `calculate_score`).
   - Use `CamelCase` for class names (e.g., `ChessEngine`).
   - Use all uppercase letters for constants (e.g., `MAX_PLAYERS`).

**Commenting**:
   - Write comments to explain complex logic or important decisions.
   - Use docstrings for all public functions and classes to describe their purpose and usage.

**Code Structure**:
   - Organize code into modules and packages as outlined in the project structure.
   - Keep related functions and classes together in the same file.

**File Naming**:
   - Use descriptive names for files that reflect their content (e.g., `data_cleaning.py`, `chess_bot.py`).
   - Use lowercase letters and separate words with underscores for file names.

## Code Style
**PEP 8 Compliance**: Follow the PEP 8 style guide for Python code. This includes:
   - Indentation: Use 4 spaces per indentation level.
   - Line Length: Limit lines to a maximum of 79 characters.
   - Blank Lines: Use blank lines to separate functions and classes.

**Formatting**: Use a code formatter (e.g., `black`) to ensure consistent formatting across the codebase.

## Version Control
1. **Branching**: Create a new branch for each feature or bug fix. Use descriptive names for branches (e.g., `feature/add-neural-network`).
2. **Commits**: Write clear and concise commit messages that describe the changes made. Use the imperative mood (e.g., "Add feature" instead of "Added feature").
3. **Pull Requests**: Submit pull requests for review before merging changes into the main branch. Ensure that all tests pass before merging.

## Testing
**Unit Tests**: Write unit tests for all new features and bug fixes. Place tests in the `tests/` directory.

**Test Coverage**: Aim for high test coverage. Use tools like `pytest` and `coverage.py` to measure coverage.

## Collaboration
**Code Reviews**: Participate in code reviews to provide and receive feedback on code quality.

**Communication**: Use Trello to track progress and communicate with team members.

## Conclusion
Following these rules will help maintain a clean, organized, and efficient codebase. Guidelines can always be changed if the team agrees on it.
